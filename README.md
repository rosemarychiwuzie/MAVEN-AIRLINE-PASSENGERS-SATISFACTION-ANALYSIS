# Introduction
This Analysis seeks to measure the satisfaction rate of 129,880 Maven Airline Passengers including additional information about each passenger,their flight and type of travel as well as their ratings of different services like cleanliness, comfort, service and overall airline experience. 

# The Dataset
The dataset imported for analysis was sourced from Maven playground website. It contains 1 CSV file, a single table structure, 129,880 records and 24 columns

# My approach for analysis
The task of this analysis is to evaluate passengers satisfaction ratings,identify the factors which are not satisfactory and profer recommendations which the airline may execute to ensure customer satisfaction which would improve sales and patronage.
On understanding the task of the analysis, i proceeded to implore the following analytical tools for a proper analysis
# Microsoft Excel: 
I utilized Excel to view and understand the parameters of my dataset i.e understand each of the 24 columns and check for their varying data types.
# PostgreSQL:
 Postgresql is a great tool for cleaning a dataset of duplicates, null values and outliers which is a very significant aspect of analysis to improve data quality and accuracy. I successfully imported the dataset into postgresql, identified the primary key, searched for duplicates and irrelevant data.
